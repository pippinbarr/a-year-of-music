Here's an easy winner for all of us, given we're familiar: Kevin Kaarl's Paris Texas. My thought here is that it's nice to listen to anyway, but I'm keen to actually sit with the lyrics and the translation to see what he's actually singing about. And just to appreciate the voice and the whole thing. Might rewatch the Tiny Desk Concert again, too, to re-experience my total shock that he looked so young (and had such a massive head?)

Oh great, we saw the film again earlier this year. The music is terrific.... the film on second viewing not so much as we found out.

Oh, oh .... not the film...ok...

#### Pippin

Hehe. That film does have a great soundtrack though, and this surely is a reference in some way?

(We saw the film in the last couple of years and it held up for me)

#### Pippin

Definitely recommend listening to it on headphones, there's some stereo stuff going on that may not be obvious without impressive speaker separation, notably his voice doubled singing the same lyrics subtly differently in each ear in one song. And also a sigh at the end of one song I don't think would be audible otherwise.

#### Jim

Now I'm on the right track...of course I love these guys, we play it endlessly at home. Think the first time we heard them was when Pippin put on their Tiny Desk tracks. Tried the headphone thing and you're right.... a much better sound than the AirMac!

#### Mary

And as a sidebar, it is Miranda's birthday today and she sent us a video of her drive to Nicole's house via the suburban streets of Atlanta, Georgia with Autumn in full swing. Then Stu ref'd a song  to celebrate  a woman driving (Paris but whatever) with ‘the warm wind in her hair' Yep. ‘The eyes of Lucy Jordan' by Marianne Faithful We played it, and wow! Such a memory push for us. Music, it does that ....

#### Pippin

Off track today with Kevin but check this out!

They are really great and the tiny desk format always works for me. Strange though how he engages with the audience between songs but is very interior when he is actually singing (eyes shut etc). But this set is just perfect

#### Mary

So listened a bit more to Kevin K and even read an interview and watched some videos. So un-smooth, so personal. He says that people who come to his shows are sometimes surprised because they are so calm, he seems very calm. When we started listening to him it felt more Mexican than it does now and I guess that was assumptions because of the language. I still haven't listened and read the lyrics in English. I did get them in Spanish. The other thing that surprised me is that his favourite band is Beach House! We played their album Bloom many many times and then we kind of forgot them. And now they are back in rotation. Thanks Kevin

#### Jim

...... and while we are at it Kevin..... thanks too for the keytar.

#### Pippin

I've been more silent than intended on this but for me it's one of my perfect albums - could listen to it pretty much any time and it feels transportive.

Was meaning to say that I find the fact it's in Spanish part of why it's compelling - sort of obvious but I feel like it makes the emotional part of his voice shine through uninterrupted. BUT also it's really weird not knowing what he's singing about!!

In reading the lyrics for como me encanta I was surprised it seemed maybe to be about suicide?? Or at least real loss... but also seemingly about being happy about that? Anyway the meaning stuff definitely threw me, which I feel like underlines my feeling that not knowing the meaning is pretty powerful?

On the OTHER hand when I first reads translation of the words it was into French and that had a different sort of halfway feeling to it, more a sense of a romantic and sad perspective, but less concrete... I don't know, that's where I get to.

Anyway what a great album, what a voice.

(sorry that was so long)

#### Mary

Definitely not too long - I hold that  record! But picking up on KK and mental health, he certainly suffers from depression and talks v openly about the pressures of touring as a musician. In this interview he talks like he sings

Plus he has attention deficit disorder and 'So in a concert, if you see that a song is not right, it's not that I forgot, it's because I lost concentration because my mind went somewhere else.' Via Rolling Stone

#### Rilla

I'm reading the interview. It's kind of interesting that the interviewer - and not KK - keeps insisting on the importance of routine in their questions. And KK, as someone with depression and ADHD, basically gently pushes that away as the solution offered by someone who doesn't know.

#### Pippin

“Check out this raw and grounding conversation” - ah, the media

#### Rilla

Defrosted mince metaphor

#### Pippin

Having read the interview I like him even more.

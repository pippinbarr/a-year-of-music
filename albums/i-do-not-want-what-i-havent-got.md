Ok here you go. One of my favourite songs is Prince doing his version (of his song) ‘Nothing Compares’. Was listening to it a few days ago and it prompted me to listen to Sinead O Connor's version. Then I listened to the rest of the album and fell in love with the whole Irish thing. So my choice is Sinead O Connor’s second album "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"

Love it.

Listened to this album earlier this year a couple times!

I tried to put up Princes version of Nothing Compares. It’s the version with Rosie Gaines. I know we don’t do singles but it is great to hear Prince’s original and see what O’Connor did with it.

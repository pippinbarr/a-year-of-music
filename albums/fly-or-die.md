> Well here's the first album. I currently cannot for the life of me remember how I heard about it. I can see I recommended it to Matt last year.

> Anyway, it's sort of uptempo jazz, a bit funky? I lack the language for this right now but there are ways in which it doesn't totally sound like what I think of as jazz, but it also totally does.

> Jamie Branch was a trumpeter, nicknamed "Breezy." She died in 2022, age 39, of a drug overdose. 

> There is also an album *Fly or Die 2* which haven't listened to as yet.

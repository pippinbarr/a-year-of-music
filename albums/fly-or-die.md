> Well here's the first album selection: *Fly or Die* by Jamie Branch, from 2017. I currently cannot for the life of me remember how I heard about it. I can see I recommended it to Matt last year.

> Anyway, it's a sort of uptempo jazz, a bit funky? I lack the language for this right now but there are ways in which it doesn't totally sound like what I think of as jazz, but it also totally does.

> Jamie Branch was a trumpeter, nicknamed "Breezy." She died in 2022, age 39, of a drug overdose. 

> There is also a live version of this album and a sequel: *Fly or Die 2*. Haven't listened to either as yet.

We were listening to Fly or Die this evening (courtesy of Pippin) and the connections to movie music sounded very real. I find it hard to remember music and I’m always asking what an album or a track are (I default to the names and titles instead) but I think it’s the variety of the tracks on this album that is really impressive to me. And having read a little about her bio, the sense of her being with these diverse musicians in the same place and making such varied sounds. I haven’t yet got a sense of whether it sounds like a single album so it’s particular sounds that cut through and tonight, tonight it was with the movies.

I agree about the movie theme effects. I enjoy this music most when she is taking the lead. Find the more abstract passages a bit…well…abstract particularly when joined by the crescendo violins. But have to say something that’s not really to my natural taste has caught on to be very likeable.

Just read a fellow musician who played with her saying how funny Jamie Branch was. He described her as, “my brain is pink slime choking on air dying of laughter funny.”

It is a pretty diverse album - starts out accessible, I think, well especially track two (Theme 001) and gets into some more abrasive/abstract stuff later on (The Storm?). I feel like thinking of it in terms of scoring a film is pretty helpful - it does seem like the different tracks are evoking some kind of scene or situation, and the titling does suggest cinema a bit? (Alison?) Theme 001, Theme 002, ... funny how the numbers suggest the potential for like a thousand of them.

I hardly ever think about song titling but it’s something I always mean to pay more attention to. Definite suggestions of a specific journey here? You “Jump Off” and eventually end up “… Back at the Ranch”… I don’t want to get too Peter and the Wolf on it, but this whole thing could be a story?

And that makes me think about the album title and cover… is this a story about being a pigeon? Dare I dream it?

Oh, I wanted to add relative to that “funny” thing - when we were at Minton’s seeing the Miles Lennox Trio there were all these moments where the musicians were so clearly talking to each other through their instruments, including making musical jokes - as in, it was obvious enough that even I could see it as a non-musician. You’d see the pianist do something, and then the saxophonist (who was not playing, just listening intently) would laugh! A very jazz thing, I’d think…

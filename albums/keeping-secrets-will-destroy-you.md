### Mary

My next choice is Bonny ‘Prince’ Billy aka Will Oldham. He’s made more than 20 albums but I’m going for the 21st: Keeping secrets will destroy you. He’s an Indie folk musician and you perhaps know him well. We have played him a lot and this album from last year is a classic. 
 
I also highly recommend a much younger Will talking about his encounter with Johnny Cash who recorded his song ‘I see a darkness.’ Since then Will has gone far from the blue eyed guy of the video (now he’s more long beard mountain man) but his comments about music towards the end of his story about a complicated series of hand-overs with the song are insightful and direct

‘I look at the world through music and how it is created and what it does and what it’s intended to do and that’s something that, in part, at least, I believe that I share with Johnny Cash. And so in that moment, it was just a thing ….I felt like, ‘Oh, this is one of the few things that I actually feel I can do, is to guide this music person through the performance of this song. And so let’s just do this.’
 
Great song, great album

Oh a nice choice! I had listened to Songs of Love and Horror this year having heard about it via the podcast Kreative Kontrol. That’s a good interview to listen to maybe:

And in looking him up a bit I find that’s he’s essentially a character in Kentucky Route Zero which is a game we love (but have never finished!!)

Meanwhile I gave this album a listen briefly this morning before Felix described it as “too calm” and demanded the Panique au Village soundtrack. Then listened to it on the supermarket run. Very nice, one of those ones that basically requires close focused listening because it’s pretty much a bunch of poems. I liked some of the words and will learn it more as we go.

And he’s ALSO one of the two guys in Old Joy!

### Jim

And I don’t thin we have seen Blue Ruin (also a title of Hari Kunzru) or Old Joy. Something else to look up after admiring the Michaels

### Pippin

(Blue Ruin was a misfire on my part!)

### Mary

Great. We don’t have to pursue film will 

### Pippin

Well, I’ve listened through Keeping Secrets Will Destroy you about three times now I think? I’m always more focused at the beginning, so the first four or five songs register more than the others. All the way through it’s pretty clearly an album where you’re listening to what he’s singing rather than necessarily thinking a lot about the production or instruments etc. Serious poet stuff. Makes me think a bit of Leonard Cohen crossed with Nick Drake? But also not really that; but those poet types. I like Willow, Pine, and Oak quite a lot. 

Also listened to the I See a Darkness album, which I think I prefer overall. Funny hearing that song in its original version; the Johnny Cash one is the one I know better. I like Oldham’s more in the end I think? Will have to relisten to the Johnny Cash one to be fair.

I have not rewatched Old Joy to see him in motion, but maybe I will.

### Mary

All interesting but quickly, I was meaning … Old Boy!!

### Pippin

But I was meaning… Old Joy (the film Will Oldham is in!)

### Mary

Ha! Read the previous messages Mary!

### Jim

Not Joy Boy the guy that hangs out on the corner of Willis Street?

### Pippin

Isn’t that Joy Beorge?

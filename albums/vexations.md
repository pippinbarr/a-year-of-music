## *Vexations* (Eric Satie, 1893–1894)

### Mary

So my selection this time round is Erik Satie’s Vexations preferably as played by Igor Levit
 
Yes, I know it lasts up to 22 hours
 
And I also know it is the same phrase repeated 840 times
 
But I also know that it will be presented in London in a performance directed by Marina Abramovic on Thursday 24 April and Friday 25 April at the South Bank Centre
 
And when I watched (some of) it during Covid in a Levit performance in Berlin he sat in an empty studio and tossed a sheet of each phrase as he played it on the floor and it was wonderful. 
 
It’s hard to find a copy of the whole thing but there are:
 
11 minutes of him playing it during Covid on video

And a much longer chunk of this same performance

The music professor talks about the piece and you can listen to some of it as the notes are highlighted so for those of us who read music (hi Rilla) you can hear and see what Satie is doing

If anyone finds a full version, maybe you’ll let us all know, maybe you will not
 
And of course there is always Gymnopédie No. 1 for light relief (great memories of Pippin it at the age of 10)

Well. I’ve listened to the long (11 hour) vexations (well the first… however long, hour or two) a couple of times now. It’s always ended up being background music, I’m usually working, I’m not really getting as much out of it as I want to. Especially as someone literally practicing scales every day, I want to figure out how to engage a bit more deeply because it sounds very “educational” as a piece of music, very about music theory maybe. So I’ll need to read about it and then promise to listen to it closely, at least for a full rendition of that one page (that you do 840 times, maybe) to try to pick out what it… teaches me?

Okay the professor video is very helpful.

So here we are in the Pompidou at the not v interesting artist when what do we hear?? Yes, vexations (v softly, too softly). Also a portrait of Satie. Our lucky day!! Thank you A Year Of Music for leading us to this connection

### Pippin

Ha! That’s pretty funny. We need to say something about Vexations or move on though! This reminds me!

### Jim

I have a few words to say about it……

Thanks Jim! I think this was a message from the universe to listen to more Satie. That’s it!

Love a Gnossienne.

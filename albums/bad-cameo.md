And I thought I’d choose ‘Bad Cameo’ by James Blake and L’il Yachty for the next fortnight. I thought I’d choose something super-produced as we’ve been listening so far to quite simply produced music. And from what I have heard so far Bad Cameo is a mix of electronic sounds, anthem rock (?) and some rap too. The only thing I know about James Blake is that he’s a mega producer and about L’il Yachty is that our friends in Sydney did not expect us to have heard of him (thank you Pippin for some Aussie cred).

And the great first comment: who is this beardless man child playing steel guitar and sounding just like Willie?

#### Pippin

Okay I’ve listened to Bad Cameo about three or four times now - most recently with close attention on a supermarket run.

I like it, Rilla liked when she heard it from upstairs. I think some of the lyrics really stand out, the hip hop style of word play, maybe especially on the first track? The various money flexes are so creative.

But somehow I think it’s so slick a lot of the time it’s almost hard to listen to closely? Think it would be amazing live…

I was wondering about the idea of post modernism in music a bit, or at least the idea of music that reveals its production in some way? Jazz obviously, but maybe Carol King too through the “thinness”? Whereas this maybe not?

#### Jim

Carol King is everywhere. I was looking at Kehinde Wiley’s website earlier this morning and saw they didn’t have a pic of his Times Square work ‘Rumors of War’. I chased up one I had taken to put up on the site and saw this poster for ‘Beautiful’ a Carol King musical!

Another diversion from ‘Bad Cameo’ …  
Now that we’re at the end of the Film Festival, we thought it might be interesting to look back at it through a music /sound lens. Although we’ve noticed music before, of course, thanks to ‘A year of music’ this time, we paid closer attention and what we understood better was the distinction between the soundtrack and the sound design.

Grand Tour directed by Miguel Gomes played with music (and everything else winning best director at Cannes this year). Most arresting was when the Blue Danube boomed out to accompany scooters in Saigon diving around the traffic, and yes, it was waltz-like. There’s also (again in Saigon) a scene where a noodle eater gets up and sings his version of ‘My way’ and of course there is the Bobby Darin song we mentioned earlier. A lot of music woven together with complex visuals, different times … it’s amazing

Soundtrack to a coup d’état is a documentary about the Democratic Republic of the Congo and what happened as their independence struggle culminated in the murder of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. It’s a terrible story and the historical footage and use of official documents and interviews is outstanding. Unfortunately, the hook chosen to structure the movie is … music!! Specifically American jazz of the 1950s and 1960s, so all the greats are. Although the CIA and American diplomats used jazz as propaganda (yes, Dizzy Gillespie, Louie Armstrong), the link sometimes feels stretched but more importantly the music is presented in brief snippets only so it feels manipulated. Great doco apart from how it uses the music.

Days of heaven from Terrence Malik delivered again and while the visuals are spectacular the music is a classic too. Starts with Saint-Saens’s Carnival of the animals over the credits, setting the scene for America in 1916 and then we get Ennio Morricone scoring the rest with his memorable brand of emotion and drama. One weirdness is that because we know the spaghetti westerns better, the music reminded us of Sergio Leone.

Then there was Paris, Texas as another visit. We hadn’t remembered the plot v well (where did that child come from ??) and Ry Cooder’s soundtrack is so memorable and been used so often that it felt a touch controlling.

‘I saw the TV glow’ by Jane Schoenbrun was definitely not our film except, except one track by Caroline Pooched and a performance of ‘Claw machine’ by Phoebe Bridgers and a kind of erotic feminist punk band (is there such a thing?). The central character is transfixed, so were we.

And ‘The village next to paradise’ dir by Mo Harawe. We went partly because it was made in Somalia but we liked its family-struggles story and non-actor actors. The soundtrack featured drones and explosions plus the Ethiopian piano playing nun Elmahdy Tsegue Maryam Guebrun (yes, we had to look up her name but we’ve listened to her a lot) which startled us and fitted so wonderfully with that precise clear sound.

I did some listening: Bad Cameo

So I sat down and listened to the whole album, with attention. I found it hard to know what to listen for or what I was listening as I don’t have a lot of context or experience to bring. I found out though that James Blake is a producer and performer and is known for dubstep while Lil Yachty is on the Atlanta trap or bubblegum trap side. That didn’t really help me! I did wonder what they had to say to each other although James Blake has produced a lot of v varied artists so maybe he was the driving force behind the collaboration.

I liked the album and more so when I listened for real rather than for background but I couldn’t figure out a lot of what was going on much of the time. I get that they both sing, Yachty raps and Blake produces and processes and is well-known for pop ‘hooks’. So there was industry surprise that they got together

The first track ‘Save the Savior’ is a crowd-pleaser with soaring vocals and layers of sound, booming thuds and rap. I responded to it just as I did to ‘In grey’ which had some pretty singing , lots of layering of course and the great line ’If everyone behaved just like me, we’d all be lonely.’ There’s a solid instrumental section that I liked but I got caught up on what all the sounds were – drums, ringing, bells, sub-vocals etc. It made me realise that most of the music I have listened to is very clear about what instrument / processing is happening when. Bad Cameo is a whole other thing. Track 3 suggested a duet more (though I wouldn’t swear to it and it seemed rather romantic with repetitive simple words ‘The only one who saw me’ etc.

I won’t go through all the tracks but I particularly liked ‘Bad Cameo’, ‘Missing man’ and ‘Transport me.’ Overall the lyrics are simple and often repeated but the feature is the ‘produced-ness’ of it all, both voices and sound. Layers and layers of sound, quite a lot of soaring and echo. On ‘Transport me’ it was as though the background soundscape was burying the lyrics, but I could still hear the words. I don’t know how they do that. And when I got to the final track ‘Red carpet’ the voice style became more famliar to me. We’ve been to a few operas and I’ve always been intrigued by that talk-singing they do (recitative) and in this track that was what it sounded like but with pronounced rhythm and the great line ‘All of my mistakes were made under a microscope.’ So I put my microscope down and listened again, while doing something else.

I know it’s a lot, and I don’t expect anyone else to go to such lengths but that gift gave me a real focus and I am loving it!

#### Jim

I’m reading a Joe Nesbo novel at the moment, usual thing – Harry Hole vs a serial killer. They, Harry and his crew, have just had a long argument about two chord songs. Born in the USA is the only two chord a song I know, and I didn’t know that before being let on to it by Harry Hole. Anyway Bruce’s song comes out bottom. Their top 2c song was ‘Jane Says’ by Jane’s Addiction. I quite like shouty songs and this is a shouty song. A bit over-produced perhaps but I did like the voice against the guitar. Jane says “I’m going to go to Spain when I get my money saved.” Same.

Oh…the runner’s up were: Nivana’s ‘Something in the way’ and Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Dreams’.

#### Pippin

Some good songs there! Have never really listened to Jane’s Addiction before…

As for Bad Cameo I keep putting it on and keep liking its vibe. Haven’t really come up with anything new, should probably read the lyrics?

#### Mary

I like the cover and it has that rather mannered style of the album itself. I even watched an interview with them and although no mention of the cover  art (!) they obviously got along very well well. It includes a fashion-y kind of photos (both wearing leather brogue style shoes not sneakers) and masses of plants in a distressed office building as well as them being interviewed. And Lil Y said he’d love to do a live show of it - so there you are! They both thought this would be … hilarious

2 guys who know a lot of music

#### Pippin

This bit in particular is something I keep thinking about music in general. Bad Cameo included. If it has lyrics. I rarely know what they are unless I was bent on memorizing them as a teenager - so I know a ton of lyrics to Leonard Cohen or Nick Cave or the Doors(!) but very little of what I listen to now… which feels like a loss.

#### Mary

I guess the lyrics got less central when they stopped being packaged with the sound. They used to come with the album although with streaming there they are, I discovered. It also feels to me that the lyrics are now often more ‘buried’ in the music and often (yes, Bad Cameo) they’re more voice sounds than telling a story, telling an emotion. I listened to Joni Mitchell’s Blue ( thank you James) and her lyrics and voice are incredible. She’s almost rapping, the way they squeeze the words into line is just how she sings. I heard her often in the past past but not more recently so she’s back!

#### Jim

……meanwhile Harry Hole and his team are discussing best ever drummer. Ring Starr-most underrated, Keith Moon from the Who most overrated and Led Zepplin’s John Bonham the best.

#### Mary

Driving the Desert Road listening to Kevin Karrl

#### Pippin

Ah, Kevin is a great choice for the road! This morning was listening to Little Simz for some energy.

I don’t think lyrics are less central though? Still a huge deal - I’d still maintain there’s an age thing going on where younger people are more likely to dive deep, feel seen, study them, in no small part because they simply have the time and music can be a much bigger part of their identity?

Looking at the lyrics for Saviour, I’d for sure say it’s more like a poem than a direct narrative… but still storytelling, more in the register of getting across a very specific feeling/experience. At least in that case.

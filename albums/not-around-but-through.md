### Pippin

Alright here’s the next one.

I don’t know much about this - our friend Matt recommended it at coffee in his classic formulation:

> Matt: Have you heard the new Amulets album?
> Pippin: *looks confused*
> Matt: Do you know them?
> Pippin: … no…
> Matt: It’s great!

In talking to Matt about it it seems like Amulets does a lot of stuff with looping and manipulating music from/on cassettes? Not sure about the specifics of this newest album, will look into it.

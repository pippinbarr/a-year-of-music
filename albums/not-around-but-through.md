Alright here's the next one.

I don't know much about this - our friend Matt recommended it at coffee in his classic formulation:

> Matt: Have you heard the new Amulets album?  
> Pippin: *looks confused*  
> Matt: Do you know them?  
> Pippin: … no…  
> Matt: It's great!  

In talking to Matt about it it seems like Amulets does a lot of stuff with looping and manipulating music from/on cassettes? Not sure about the specifics of this newest album, will look into it.

A second full listen across this morning while having breakfast with Felix, making coffee, getting started on work. Very good loud on speakers, though curious to check it out on good headphones as well as I bet there's a bunch of detail in there as well as the big sound and wash. Rilla and I both hear a lot of Mogwai in it - but as we said this morning, kind of Mogwai the way they should be, rather than the way they are (at least now, where they've gone a bit more pop). And early in the album I was definitely thinking of the epic soundscape style of Sigur Ros, without the keening.

I also immediately bought an Amulets t-shirt and wrote to their website email address to point out a potential typo but also just to declare my fandom - hopefully it reaches the guy.

I have just read this. Yes, it is long but for those of us who haven't hung out in a recording studio or with musicians or played around with tape, its got a lot going for it as Bob Dylan is clearly a genius

Why A year of Music is of value: we were playing Sault and a window installer stopped as he was going out the front door, listened carefully and said ‘I like this. I really like this.' 

### Pippin

Hehe yeah, Sault is a catchy one!

### Jim

I think Brian Eno might be my limit. I just can't get into Amulets at all.

### Pippin

Oh no! Well, that's acceptable. Funny thing, personal taste!

Let's hold for Mary's treatise and move on!

### Mary

Treatise huh!! On it

### Pippin

Tome?

### Mary

Perhaps. Plus I think Jim is next? 

Has anyone died recently??

### Pippin

A little bit of my heart died when Jim didn't like Amulets…

### Mary

Well I am a fan, and here are my (Ok, extensive) thoughts. I found this album mind-expanding!

AMULETS, NOT AROUND BUT THROUGH 2025

So there was divided opinion about this one in our household as you know. I listened to it with concentration after a few times of having had it more as background. I'd liked it as background but the full on listening certainly suggested a lot (although not at tome level).

First I can get rid of my initial Sigur Ros comparison as I listened to some of their albums we'd loved and that really underlined how witchy and spiritualized SR are and Amulets is neither of those things. I haven't listened to much (any?) of this full-on experimental tape manipulation sound and it needs a whole lot of vocab that I don't have to really come to grips with it but some thoughts.

At just a simple response level patterns I heard

- Waves and sweeps of sound building and then disintegrating or to the edge of disintegrating, and doing it repeatedly (e.g. Crude Soil)
- Multiple layers of sound and then a sense of emergence from this dense atmosphere 
- A propulsive drone studded with higher pitched sounds
- Overall a real stretching of the higher pitched sound (which may also be a result of my hearing being poorer at the lower end so the higher notes are more apparent to me) and sometimes to an almost uncomfortable sharpness (e.g. Shape)
- The descriptors that make the most sense to me for his music tend to be spatial – I'm always thinking waves, construction, sweeps and of course soundscape
- Myriads has the most plays on YouTube music by far and it is certainly more lyrical, almost cinematic and there is what sounds like a guitar in there along with thumps. It also plays with a tune that you can't quite place as well as what I feel fireworks sound like. Very approachable
- ‘Lifelike' with Midwife is more choral and clearer rhythmically. It is almost waiting for a regular song but that never appears and is instead buried by other layers of sound. Although it is otherworldly it is very clear and the voice seems to know what it is doing. I really liked it and its lovely soft outro.
- And then there are the chimes and the beeps throughout the album, often in the high range. I'm thinking here of Veils and but they recur often. They make it feelsas though there are bits of other songs that have been buried in the layers. It reminded me of Russell Hoban's Ridley Walker where language has been so worn and forgotten and reinvented so that it now sounds like something v different.
- Refs to rock. These were most apparent to me in Veils which was kind of like a rock concert at serious pace. Rocking with layers and then big thrums and a major finale as the thrums continue and the back layers disintegrate. Another favorite track
- Conventional instruments restaged. Sun Unseen does this with I swear someone picking away at a keyboard / piano with strange sounds swooping back with the high pitch holding it all together (almost). This song builds to tidal waves of mixed sounds and vibrations and under it a wavering tune, and then it just stops.
- Serious beeping. This happens in Lowercase letters playing in intricate rhythm with sweeping sounds that morph into what sound like distorted words which become really ‘conversational' in a strange call and response pattern. I really liked this track and especially its outro showcasing tiny beeping. This really sounded to me like language of a different kind.
- Use of very different sounds – there's many. In Infinites there's a sound that could almost be from a haka, a kind of chest compression as the structure of the music builds and then collapses. Then it ends with a pacey background pulling it all along like a tidal wave while the cheeps and chirps and beeps hold on for dear life to the end as the waves of sound just move on.
- And then there is the movement of sound across speakers. I only heard it in the track Burnt Siennas but imagine it with excellent hearing and a big sound system! This time the waves of sounds move from ear to ear and have what feels like a softer interior. There's a touch of Sigur Ros but they are facing an emergency now! The strong droning could have been noise from our painters, but if not I really liked how the sound starts winding down and vibrating with almost kindly tones, softer, softer and then, out.

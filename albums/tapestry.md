Ok, as I mentioned my first choice, Ruger Asiwaju’s album The Second Wave sounded so great on 125th Street was not so sweet when listening to the lyrics at home. But it did make me think about how music punctuates and describes the events in your life which sent me back to Carol King. We played this album every day for such a long time when we were living in Hackthorne Road in Christchurch the year we got married. Some years later (1975) we were travelling through India and stayed in Mahabalipuram. The only album available for the days we were there was Tapestry, so it’s being in love in India as well. Listening to it now it reminds me how ‘produced’ music is now, but I still love it. There is another great album of King doing the Tapestry songs live at Hyde Park if you become obsessed.

Today I picked up the Tapestry challenge! An incredible roster of songs obviously but it took me a while to get into the sound which feels thin at the start but I think that first song (I feel the earth move) is the thinnest of all. After that it sounds to me as though there is a lot more going on with the band (even violins on track 7). I looked her up and was amazed to find out about her pro NYC writing career with her first husband. They wrote Up on the roof when she was 19! Then she heads off to LA with her 2 kids and Tapestry is her second album. I realised she is not a great singer when I heard a live version of Natural woman by Aretha Franklin but there is something so personal and confidential about her versions. ‘You’ve got a friend in me” was written with her ex-husband in mind and it goes to the heart. She has range - ‘Way over yonder ‘like a spiritual, ‘Will you love me tomorrow’ the ultimate lover song, ‘Where you lead’ with a driving beat and backing vocals for the ultimate driving song, ‘Tapestry’ weirdly like a Medieval Faire (v hippy) and ‘Natural woman’ where in her version there is a real conversation between her voice and the instruments etc. So an album choice I thought would not bring much new to me but , I was wrong. Am now listening to James Taylor of the same period!

Yeah I enjoyed this pick. I’ve listened to the album a couple of times, though mostly as a background to life. Similarly surprised by that whole other world of song *writers* being such a massive thing.

It either sounds very of its time or it sounds influential? Or both. Can kind of hear things like the Beatles, Elton John, Captain and Tennille, Dusty Springfield (who she wrote for), others I’m sure.

The album cover has a cat, so I’m sold.

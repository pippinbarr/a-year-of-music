Okay next album!

I saw this guy play in front of less than 10 people at a very small place in Texas when I was visiting Texas A&M to give a talk. It was *very* loud and ear-damage-y feeling. We didn't stay for the whole show and I remember being kind of relieved to leave and to chalk it down to a fun and random experience while travelling. But somehow since then I have ended up keeping his album on my phone and listening to it *quite often*. I got in touch with the (very music-savvy) guy who took me to the show (and who had had a similarly bemused response to the live show) and he told me Donnie is firmly in his rotation too.

There's something about Donnie.

Today’s great sadness was learning that my favourite line on this album is a mishearing. In Utopia’s Shit I thought it was

> You give  
> And then it’s given  

But it’s actually just

> You give  
> And then misgiving

Which is not bad but not as good as my mishear. Overall though this song is my candidate for best writing, the previous two, at least, are pretty cringe when you really tune in!

#### Jim

I’d just like to put in a word for what was once our favorite band in the 70s - Black Sabbath who invented the whole Doom Pop thing…. as well as Heavy Metal of course.

#### Pippin

Recommended starter album?

Looks like it’s Paranoid

#### Jim

Yes, that’s the one. Although from memory it was Children of the Grave we played endlessly

It’s a single not an album

#### Jim

OK….we have just listened to ‘A man that’s go no soul’ for about the fifth time tonight. I’m sould (pun alert). It’s great. Love an anthem and especially one that has the ghost of Johnny Cash riding along with it.

#### Pippin

Wait is that “A man”? Or is that a new single or something? I’m currently appreciating “A man” on the bus.

"My blood’s gone cold but it still runs thick"

"The voodoo’s old but it does the trick"

Really enjoy some of his writing, kind of obvious and bravado-y but also that kind of vampire weariness.

Hearing some Leonard Cohen in This Wonderful World

Which actually raises a point of tension for me with Donnie around whether it would work as well with more poetic language or not. Is the kind of “low hanging fruit” writing an important part of the listening experience? Like you can kind of relax and not think too hard..

And I went down the Donny video rabbit hole and they feel strangely sweet. Very genre of course. There’s a lot of hair, a lot of tattoos, a lot of symbol awareness, very southern, but more comic than bad boy. Resurrect me is the finest. Yes, he is dead and buried. Donny delivers

And we are now listening to Black Widow and Black Sabbath … 

#### Pippin

Yeah I enjoyed checking out Slayer actually, strangely chill.

Fine to move on from Donnie from my perspective! Did the whole album today. Definitely think it’s stronger in the front end. Made me remember my obsession with The Sisters of Mercy back in the day though.

I was intrigued by the southernness of the Donnie world and all the time I kept on thinking of those ten or so people coming to listen to him in Texas. It was a surprise but then I remembered we heard from Harry Cundy who was with an NZ band that toured the US a couple of times. This was ages ago but it was the randomness of their audience numbers that ground them down. Sometimes they were packed, and sometimes not so. I get it for an NZ band but Donnie has proper high concept videos and carefully developed visual imagery etc etc. Briefly back to the music: I figured that voice must be a baritone. It’s far more traditionally ‘musical’ than many other contemporary white vocalists like maybe Bon Iver or Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy. I’ve lost most of what I’ve listened to other the years but I’m thinking of that low key male voice that doesn’t push for virtuoso singing but focuses on the lyrics. Donnie does not sound like that! He is far more anthems and drama. I liked the sound although not so excited by the styling

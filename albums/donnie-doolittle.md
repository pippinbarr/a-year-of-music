Okay next album!

I saw this guy play in front of less than 10 people at a very small place in Texas when I was visiting Texas A&M to give a talk. It was *very* loud and ear-damage-y feeling. We didn't stay for the whole show and I remember being kind of relieved to leave and to chalk it down to a fun and random experience while travelling. But somehow since then I have ended up keeping his album on my phone and listening to it *quite often*. I got in touch with the (very music-savvy) guy who took me to the show (and who had had a similarly bemused response to the live show) and he told me Donnie is firmly in his rotation too.

There's something about Donnie.

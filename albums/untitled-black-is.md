My turn to nominate an album and I go for one from 2020 - Sault’s Untitled {Black Is). It’s labelled as R&B, Soul and Funk and they are a collective and constantly called ‘elusive’, ‘mysterious’ etc.  We have only got part way thru this album so far but is sounding great! Lots of learning underway as I have Neve heard them before. Onwards!!

“Throughout 2022, after releasing the orchestral instrumental album Air, the collective surprise-released five subsequent studio albums, simultaneously.” — Wikipedia

Including this one, which I’m enjoying on the 480 bus to work.

Also “Between their 2019 debut and late 2023, they had never played a live show, given an interview or released a music video in support of their music”

Quite the sensibility!

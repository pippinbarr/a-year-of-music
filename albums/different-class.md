Pulp: Different Class

#### Pippin

The main thing that Pulp triggers in me is listening to their album This is Hardcore while walking around in Paris after Rilla had left. For some reason I especially remember listening to it on the streets near to the Institut du monde arabe and the Jardin des Plantes. That is a great album and Jarvis Cocker’s voice and delivery and preoccupations are just iconic to me especially because of that specific listening experience.

I think this album (Different Class) is probably their most well known? At any rate it has Common People which I at least thing of as “the main Pulp song”, and it’s really great. I love the storytelling nature of it, and just the straight up class anguish and pride - it’s very direct! And it’s also just a great song musically, really drives along.

PULP, DIFFERENT CLASS 1995
 
First, the excellent cover. I liked it a lot and saw that it was a photo taken of a real wedding party (of good sports) who posed with cardboard cut-outs of the band. What a memorable day it must have been.
 
I don’t have all the associations with Pulp that you have, Pippin and Rilla, although Common People and Bar Italia rang distant bells. And I do recall when Jarvis Cocker toured solo in NZ we mis-tied him up with Joe and wondered why he was such a big deal. A judgement of sight, not sound
 
I can only compare this album with some more recent pop music and it has certainly become more complex and processed. Here the lyrics seem very important and that was what distinguished this album for me.
 
I was amazed from time to time how much Cocker sounded like David Bowie. His phrasing is excellent, and he can make anything sound conversational when he choses to. A few tracks relied on that literal talking for structure (and what a great line: like some small animal that only comes out at night = love)
 
The tone of the lyrics was arresting– so much like mid-1990s British artists who were proud of their working class origins, or claimed them anyway. But here it is not revolutionary talk, it’s mild class war served with revenge on the side (I Spy) and of course Common People). It feels as though today a lot of music skirts overt politics like this or assumes we’re all agreed so references them rather than positions by them and rap has become so central it’s a different world.
 
Some themes might be tucked back in the drawer today perhaps? E.g. I really love it when you tell me to stop’ but overall an interesting view of women – some great observations and sometimes it’s hard to tell whose POV he’s taking, maybe both? Esp in Underwear ‘I couldn’t stop it now/ There’s no way to get out/ He’s standing far too near’ and Live Bed Show ‘Cause it’s changed from something comfortable to something else instead.’
 
Lots of specific everyday references too ground it – from supermarkets and art school (St Martin’s College) to Gramsci perhaps? And ‘it’s around the corner in Soho where the other broken people go’. In fact there are lots of refs to just staying in bed
 
I really liked Common People of course, Feeling … called Love, Bar Italia, Monday Morning. And it was interesting to see how famous they were in the 1990s esp in the UK (and NZ). Listening to this also showed me how much I rely on lyrics but here I was actually reading them rather than simply listening. Hearing the music and the lyrics at the same time turns out to be a challenge for me.

"If you called your dad he could stop it all" is such a good line, and emblematic of that specific blended with universal thing they’re so good at. And that combined with Jarvis Cocker’s delivery is awesome to behold. I hear the Bowie thing sometimes for sure, I also hear what I think is the influence on Flight of the Conchords - that musical storytelling thing.

That’s the kind of poetry I’m here for.

Also love this sequence in Live Need Show:

> The bed has seen it all  
> From the first time to the last  
> The silences of now  
> And the good times of the past  
> And it only cost ten pounds  
> From a shop just down the road  
> Mind you, that was seven years ago  
> And things where very different then.

So. This album is the first one I bought for myself on CD 💿 at the age of 13 so it’s personally meaningful. Had some idea at the time that it was subversive and a bit sexy, but in 2024 it champions a model of desperate and stalkerish masculinity - which at the time was totes acceptable if I recall correctly (in an outcast “I watch the X Files”, “i have 2 friends” kind of way). There was no female equivalent; JC was definitely an antihero for me. The level and type of pathos they manage to capture is still unparalleled for me. The voice still makes me weak in the knees.

#### Pippin

“The voice” is a very good point. I feel like he’s almost “getting away with” something with some of the level of panty groans and other stuff; so much passion that it can’t always be a word. It’s true there are some very awkward feeling moments in there… on first hearing Underwear just felt super duper problematic to me, but as I read the lyrics (and I think this is true of a bunch of or maybe all of the song), it’s more complicated and self-aware. It’s creepy but also actively trying to get at something, not just being stupidly creepy and that’s it? The point of view in Underwear is really weird, for example, not at all straightforward.

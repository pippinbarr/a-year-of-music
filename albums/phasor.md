I like Brama but the energy is wrong right now.

This instead.

ALRIGHT let me break the ice and say… I really love this album. It’s great being in the world music to me, works in the background, works on the commute. Doesn’t demand a super close listen (for me, though perhaps that’s also the language barrier), but is very … just nice to listen to frankly. I love the third track, Best for You and Me. 

Only just checked and the band name apparently means “Black Ice Cream”?? That’s strange and cool. Black sesame perhaps?

Also it turns out the band is essentially a guy, Roberto Carlos Lange, who grew up in Florida with Ecuadorian parents. He went to SCAD and studied Computer Art and Sound Design! So he’s basically our colleague Gabriel Vigliensoni.

What’s not to like, basically.

Ok my friends, I am back in listening mode! I’ve been a bit low about it but now …back to the wonderful Helado Negro

### Jim

You probably know this already but his name is Roberto Carlos Lange. But did you know he’s one of your people, having a degree in Computer Art and Animation from Savannah College of Art and Design. I didn’t actually get to listen to the first choice but so love this one. Mary has it playing now and, as you say, the perfect sooth for very strange times.

Helado Negro, Phasor, 2024

I loved this album. We have played it many many times (perhaps Pippin you gave us a link to it before you nominated it for xx music? A real keeper. And I got a great personal connection on track 1LFO (Lupe finds Oliveros). A couple of years back I edited Claudia’s PhD and then book on art and heartbeats. They each included a chapter on the avant garde musician Pauline Oliveros so I know a bit about her and there she was in the track list. Apparently she is known as ‘the goddess of soldering’ creating instruments and worked with synthesizers and this really highlighted the world Phasor operates in that I don’t hear so much myself. I had to listen for it.  I found the album immensely lovable and enticing and the fact that is also a major experimental project came as news to me. The commercial length songs buried that thought for me and I am more used to experimental stuff being long and often not relaxing or light or warm! How great to hear something of that tradition of synthesizer beeps, dashes, swishing sounds with a Latinx vibe and dance rhythm and an intimate voice laid on top. Great choice

### Pippin

Really interesting/odd the connection to our world of computational stuff. I don’t hear it in the slightest but nice to know it’s there.

Meanwhile the new Bonny Prince Billy is good

(Next album? Jim ?)

We watched A Complete Unknown yesterday on the Big Screen at the Embassy. We really enjoyed it and even though the audience that afternoon was small, it reminded me of the pleasure of watching together and at mega scale. Chalamet was convincing but it was the sense of the period I came away with. How aspirational the US’s politics were, then. Dylan’s songs are beyond familiar of course but it was a surprise to think of how super famous he was in his early twenties and how much was laid on him. And then there’s the musician thing. Not the ‘voice of a generation’ but a musician. The scenes with him in the recording studio with his team showed why he loved all that and why he walked away from being the guy with the guitar. Being in a band looked like a lot of fun. My fave was the guy who wasn’t going to be allowed in because they already had a great guitarist and he did’t play keyboard but who simply (and quickly) figured out how to turn the thing on and came up with a magical chord. Story is it really happened and the guy was Al Kooper

### Pippin

Hadn’t really thought of watching it… good to know!
